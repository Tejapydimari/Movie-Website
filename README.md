# Movie-Website

Creating a movie website using HTML and CSS involves crafting a visually appealing and user-friendly platform to showcase films. Start by structuring the website with HTML, defining elements like headers, navigation bars, and sections for featured movies, descriptions, and user reviews. Utilize CSS to enhance the design with styles, including layouts, colors, fonts, and responsive elements to ensure compatibility across devices. Incorporate images, posters, and trailers to engage users visually. Organize content into categories such as genres, top-rated, and latest releases. Finally, optimize for accessibility and SEO to reach a wider audience. Host the project on GitHub for version control and collaboration.
